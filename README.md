# OTP Bot with Twilio and Telegram

Hello everyone! Welcome to this project for a secure OTP bot. This bot uses Twilio to send calls and Telegram to receive OTP codes via a Telegram bot. It includes encryption for the codes and a password to secure access.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following:
- **Python 3.9+** installed on your system.
- A **Twilio** account with a valid phone number.
- A Telegram bot (create one with [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots)).
- **ngrok** installed on your system.

## Installing Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required libraries:

```bash
pip install flask pyngrok telebot twilio cryptography
```

## Configuration

To configure the bot, update the following variables in the otp_bot.py script:

TWILIO_SID: Replace with your Twilio SID.
TWILIO_TOKEN: Replace with your Twilio Auth Token.
TWILIO_NUMBER: Replace with your Twilio phone number.
TELEGRAM_TOKEN: Replace with your Telegram bot token.


## Running the Bot

To run the bot, follow these steps:

Start ngrok to expose your local server:

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```
Execute the Python script:

```bash
python otp_bot.py
```

The script will display the webhook URL generated by ngrok. This URL will be used to connect your Telegram bot.
